## Description

This repository contains solutions to three JavaScript code challenges tackled over the weekend.

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
Prompt the user to input student marks between 0 and 100, then output the corresponding grade: A (>79), B (60-79), C (49-59), D (40-49), E (<40).

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector
Write a program to calculate demerit points for speeding drivers. If speed is less than 70 km/h, print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the limit, give one demerit point. If more than 12 points, print "License suspended".

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
Calculate an individualâ€™s net salary based on inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate PAYE (Tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

Refer to [aren.co.ke](https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm) for tax rates and [KRA](https://www.kra.go.ke/en/individual/calculate-tax/calculating-tax/paye) for PAYE information.
##Use of readline module
I used index.html since i cannot use readline therefore i  run my output in the browser(console).
